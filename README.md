# LongArithmeticCalculator

Usually, for arithmetical operations, standard built-in types as integer, float etc are enough. However, in some cases, the operands are so big, that they don't fit in any built-in type. For example:
  -Computing fundamental mathematical constants such as Ï€ to millions or more digits 
  -Investigating the precise behavior of functions where certain questions are difficult to explore via analytical methods
  -Rendering fractal images with extremely high magnification
In the above cases, Arbitrary-precision arithmetic would be the solution. Let's try to simplify a scientist's life with a calculator which can operate numbers with any given length.

## Description
Implement a calculator with a graphical user interface, which provides a user with all standard operations:
  -Addition 
  -Subtraction 
  -Multiplication
  -Division
Your application should be able to manipulate integers of any length.
